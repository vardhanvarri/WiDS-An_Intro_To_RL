# Resources

We will be mainly following the books below:

1. **Sutton & Barto** for the theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning. 

2. **Grokking Reinforcement Learning by Miguel Morales** for the implementation details.

We will also be learning from the Playlist of David Silver which you could find here -

## Tentative Schedule

- Week 1:
Quick introduction to Python and useful Python modules such as NumPy, MatPlotLib, TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc.

- Weeks 2 and 3:
Introduction to Reinforcement Learning from Sutton and Barto, and implementation of few basic algorithms.

- Week 4:
Studying Deep Reinforcement Learning and improving our agaent.
